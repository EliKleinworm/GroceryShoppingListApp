Business Modeling
- User initiates request for desired SW product. Contacts service provider and negotiates the terms. Submits request in writing
- Done

Requirements Gathering
- Hold discussion with stakeholders from problem domain, and bring out as much info as possible. They become segregated to user requirements, system requirements, functional requirements
- Done

Analysis and Design
- Developers decide a roadmap of plan and which SW model to use. Understand product limitations, system related problems, changes in existing systems beforehand, identifying, and addressing impact of project. Analyze the scope of the project and plan schedule and resources. Use information from requirements as inputs
- Entry Criteria: user requirements, system requirements, functional requirements. 
- Exit Criteria: Logical Design, Physical Design, meta-data, data dictionaries, logical diagrams, data-flow diagrams, pseudocode

Implementation
- Programming in the suitable language and develop error-free executable programs efficienty
- Entry Criteria: Logical Design, Physical Design, meta-data, data dictionaries, logical diagrams, data-flow diagrams, pseudocode
- Exit Criteria: Code and updated documentation for the program

Test
- Testing conducted at module testing, program testing, product testing, in-house testing, user product testing. Early discovery of errors and their remedy is the key to reliable SW.
